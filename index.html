    <h2> Professional Experience: </h2>
    <p> Throughout my professional life I have always been in service. For nearly seven years I was an officer in the US Navy, first as the Auxiliaries Officer aboard <i>USS MONTEREY (CG-61)</i> in Norfolk, VA, then as an intelligence officer in South Korea and in the United Kingdom. Following my naval career I worked for the Mayor of Seattle as a policy analyst and constitutent relations specialist. Most recently I was the Market Programs Director at Seattle Tilth (now Tilth Alliance), where I managed the sale and distribution of produce from our non-profit incubator farm program, Seattle Tilth Farm Works. Our primary market outlets were a 460 member Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program and a heavily subsidized CSA known as the Good Food Bag, which provided over 7,000 bags of local organic produce per year to families in King County who would otherwise be unable to afford it.  </p>
